# Vigenere-Cypher
This is a encryption/decryption program that uses the Vigenere method. I wrote this program as my final project in my discrete structures class

DIRECTIONS:
This program is mostly self explanatory and describes the necessary inputs when running.
For instance the string inputs for your text and for your keywords MUST be CAPITALIZED

Tips:
the program will execute it's Encrypting and Decrypting functions seperately. It's suggested to use the Encrypting part of the program first and remember your Keyword so that when you decrypt you'll use the same keyword and the encrypted string it gave you earlier. 

BOUNDARIES:
No special characters or numbers or anything like that will function. just the capital letters of the 26 letter english alphabet for the text and the keyword will work.
